  <h4>Development</h4>
  The greatest chalange developing this game, was to create a complex and permissive scenario, and to create an artificial intelligence that was capable to explore the minimum spaces of the scenario. The game was made originally with UDK 3, and then updated to UE4. Unfortunally, the UE4 version have not been launched.</p>

  <h2>Cute Evil</h2>
  <p>I was with the Machine Bear’s team and friends developing Cute Evil at Global Game Jam.</p>
  <img src="/assets/games/jam/CuteLogo.png" width="420">

  <h4>The Game</h4>
  <p>It was difficult to think about some thing with theme “Ritual”, but we think about day-by-day routine, indigena costumes, religious rituals, magician’s rituals, and so on. After a great process of brain storming, we decided to do a hardcore game, with a simple history. You play as a girl that suffer some bully and decide to revenge this, by doing a ritual to cast an demon to help her. From this point is just blood and destruction in front of you!</p>
  <img src="/assets/games/jam/cute.png" width="420">

  <h4>Global Game Jam - 2016</h4>
  <p>The Jam had the theme 'Ritual', and we get the diversifier 'To infinity and beyond!'(and zero on the 'Gandhi’s Game'). We worked on the game within the company building(Machine Bear), we were able to see the work of other professionals and enthusiasts of game development, there was 14 people working on the game, in the 48 hours of development, we could create a complex game, with good game play.</p>
  <img src="/assets/games/jam/tumblr_o1xlrkQF0o1tbhz3oo4_400.png" width="420">


  <h4>Development</h4>
  <p>The game was made with UE4. As programmer, the greatest chalange to the game was to develop the procedural map generator, and the AI to work in the map. Everything was realy simple becasuse of the time, but we could get a realy satifatory result, due the great coordenation that we was able to create within the group.</p>

  <h2>Lunar Killer</h2>
  <p>I was with the TechSchool Team (I must thanks a lot TechSchool to get this team of champions together), that is composed by game development and 3D modeling students from TechSchool.</p>
  <img src="/assets/games/jam/StartMenu.jpg" width="420">

  <h4>The Game</h4>
  <p>The Jam’s theme was “Life in Space”. We decided to develop a game about a alien that arise in moon and was trying to destroy the Earth! And you must be the hero, in the more insane way, and kill the monster!</p>
  <img src="/assets/games/jam/tumblr_o1xgqjP2qq1tbhz3oo3_500.png" width="420">

  <h4>libGDX Jam - 2016</h4>
  <p>The libGDX Jam was a completely different experience. We had one month to develop an entire game from scratch, using libGDX, a framework to develop games in Java.</p>
  <img src="/assets/games/jam/tumblr_o1xgqjP2qq1tbhz3oo4_500.png" width="420">

  <h4>Development</h4>
  <p>Is not easy to develop a game with Game Engines, but develop a game without a Game Engine is harder. The game was developed using only java and libGDX. I think that developing a game without game engines is something that all game developers should do at least once. The game ended up with some bugs, due the difficulties of developing a 3D game, with a very limited time, but the experience was awesome!</p>

  <h2>Other Eyes</h2>
  <p>I was with Machine Bear’s Team and some friends developing the Other Eyes. The Jam’s Theme was “Viagem”(Voyage, travel, trip, …). We decided to develop a game that covers various types of “trips”, that is: Go from point A to B, interdimensional travel, the vacation trip… Other Eyes is about a girl that lost her dog and must go in a interdimensional travel to find the pet! Travelling between a paradisiac world and a crystal made world, you must solve some puzzles to keep going. The Jam time was very short, so we can’t work much in the game, so it is very short, but we are thinking of get some days to finish the game. We develop the game with Unreal Engine 4, the low poly visual makes the game be very clean and beautiful!</p>
