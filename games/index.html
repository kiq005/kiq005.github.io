  <h3>Urban Legends</h3>
  <p>I worked on Urban Legends at the game and level designer and programmer, at Machine Bear’s team. The game plays on an old hospital, with a horror theme. The greatest chalange developing this game, was to create a complex and permissive scenario, and to create an artificial intelligence that was capable to explore the minimum spaces of the scenario. The game was made originally with UDK 3, and then updated to UE4. Unfortunally, the UE4 version have not been launched.</p>

  <h3>Chameleon Runner</h3>
  <p>I work on Chameleon Runner as programmer. In the game, you play as a chameleon, trying to escape from an lab. The game was made with Stencyl, my job was to develop the procedural map generation.</p>

  <h3>Cute Evil</h3>
  <p>I was with the Machine Bear’s team and friends developing Cute Evil! The Jam’s theme was “Ritual”. It was difficult to think about some thing with theme “Ritual”, but we think about day-by-day routine, indigena costumes, religious rituals, magician’s rituals, and so on. And we decide to a hardcore game, with a simple history. You play as a girl that suffer some bully and decide to revenge this, by doing a ritual to cast an demon to help her. From this point is just blood and destruction in front of you! (We will receive zero on “Gandhi’s Game” Diversify). The team was awesome and the development process was really funny!</p>

  <h3>Lunar Killer</h3>
  <p>Is not easy to develop a game with Game Engines, but develop a game without a Game Engine is harder. But that is a challenge that every game develop must try! I was with the TechSchool Team (I must thanks a lot TechSchool to get this team of champions together), that is composed by game development and 3D modeling students from TechSchool. The Jam’s theme was “Life in Space”. We decided to develop a game about a alien that arise in moon and was trying to destroy the Earth! And you must be the hero, in the more insane way, and kill the monster! The game finish with some bugs, and I forgot to post it before and ask for votes (I has rushing with every thing). But the experience was awesome!</p>

  <h3>Other Eyes</h3>
  <p>I was with Machine Bear’s Team and some friends developing the Other Eyes. The Jam’s Theme was “Viagem”(Voyage, travel, trip, …). We decided to develop a game that covers various types of “trips”, that is: Go from point A to B, interdimensional travel, the vacation trip… Other Eyes is about a girl that lost her dog and must go in a interdimensional travel to find the pet! Travelling between a paradisiac world and a crystal made world, you must solve some puzzles to keep going. The Jam time was very short, so we can’t work much in the game, so it is very short, but we are thinking of get some days to finish the game. We develop the game with Unreal Engine 4, the low poly visual makes the game be very clean and beautiful!</p>
