I worked on [Chameleon Runner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourname.camaleaorunner) as programmer, at [Machine Bear](http://machinebear.com).

#### The Game

Chameleon Runner is a mobile game, [available to Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yourname.camaleaorunner). You play as Leon, the Chameleon, trying to scape from a lab.

#### Development

The game was made with [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com/), my job was to develop the procedural map generation.
