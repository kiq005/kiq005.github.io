#### The Game

When I still on Machine Bear, I give the idea to we develop a game with some social impact in mind, there was were **Back to Home** started. The game is about a blind girl, that lost her guide dog, and she have to discover the world around her, while she searchs for her dog. As the game happens in a "children mind", elements of fantasy merges with the reality, and the game ambientation is defined by the beliefs of the girl.

#### Development

The game was developed with UE4, using only [blue prints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/). The main chalange as Programmer and Game Designer was to develp a system to allow the world generation, and keep the game running smooth, giving all that visual to the game.

#### Social

The initial idea of the game was to develop systems to allow blind people to play it, yet, making the game fun for everybody that plays the game. Also, donating some part of the revenues to organizations that helps blind people is another topic discussed when we started developing the game.

#### [BGS - 2016](http://www.brasilgameshow.com.br/site-novo-da-bgs-2016-no-ar/)

If you were on the BGS 2016, you may remember the game on the Machine Bear stand, side-by-sude with [Aron: On Guardian Trials](https://brenooshiro.itch.io/aron), from [Frozen Dog Squad](https://www.facebook.com/FrozenDogSquad/). The games received a lot of players, and those who have given the name were able to download and play the game at home. With the tips we received and observation that we are able to peform at the event, we were able to update the game, and correct all the bugs that appeared.

#### Future

When I droped Machine Bear, at November 2016, they had given to me the rights over the game. There still the idea to keep developing the game, but just small advances have been made since them. I'm giving priority to other projects, but as I'm finishing them, the plan is to get back developing this game as soon as possible.
