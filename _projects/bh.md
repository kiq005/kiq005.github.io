#### The Game


When I worked on Machine Bear, I was able to start a project that kept in mind the social impact, that is how **Back to Home** began. The game is about a blind girl, that lose her guide dog, and start a journey to find him, while discovering an entirely new world, using her senses and mind to perceive the environment. As the game occurs in a children mind, elements of fantasy merge with the real world, and we see as the girl believes that the world is, based on her senses and life experience, that evolves, while she advances on her adventure.

#### Development

The game was developed with UE4, using only [blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/). The Game Design focus on mechanics that give the player some experience of a blind person while keeping the game fun and playable; there was a big challenge to have an equilibrium of the experience versus fun. From the programming front, the trial was to develop the world generation system, with effects that give the game some childish feelings while keeping the game running smoothly even on slow computers.

#### Social

The starting idea of the project was to allow blind people to play the game, yet, keeping the game fun for people that are and those who aren't blind. There was also the idea of donating some part of the revenues to organizations that help blind people.

#### [BGS - 2016](http://www.brasilgameshow.com.br/site-novo-da-bgs-2016-no-ar/)

If you have been on the BGS 2016, you may remember the game on the Machine Bear's stand, side-by-side with [Frozen Dog Squad's](https://www.facebook.com/FrozenDogSquad/) [Aron: On Guardian Trials](https://brenooshiro.itch.io/aron). Both games have received a lot of players, and those who signed up the list were able to download and play the game at home. We were able to improve the game, with all the tips we received and the observations that we performed during the event. 

#### Future

When I quit Machine Bear, in November 2016, they have given to me the rights over the game. I wish to get back developing the game, but first I am reworking some ideas of the game, and looking for a team of game developers to help on the project.
