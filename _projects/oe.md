I was with Machine Bear's team and some friends developing Other Eyes.

#### [The Game](http://www.spjam.com.br/hackathon/othereyes)

The Jam's theme was "Viagem"(Portuguese world for voyage/travel/trip). Other Eyes is a game that covers different types of "trips". It is about a girl that loses her dog have to go traveling to different dimensions looking for her pet, solving a lot of puzzles to keep advancing in the game.

#### [SPJam - 2015](http://www.spjam.com.br/events/spjam2015)

It was my first Game Jam. The time was short, but the experience teaches us a lot about game development, especially because we were able to see the work and talk to other developers within the event.

#### Development

The low poly visual makes the game very clean and beautiful. As programmer and Level Designer, the main challenge was to create the two worlds system, and the interactions between the two worlds.
