I was with the TechSchool Team (I must thanks a lot TechSchool to get this team of champions together), that is composed by game development and 3D modeling students from TechSchool.

#### The Game

The Jam’s theme was “Life in Space”. We decided to develop a game about a alien that arise in moon and was trying to destroy the Earth! And you must be the hero, in the more insane way, and kill the monster!

#### libGDX Jam - 2016

The [libGDX Jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam) was a completely different experience. We had one month to develop an entire game from scratch, using [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), a framework to develop games in Java.

#### Development

Is not easy to develop a game with Game Engines, but develop a game without a Game Engine is harder. [The game](https://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam/rate/49383) was developed using only java and libGDX. I think that developing a game without game engines is something that all game developers should do at least once. The game ended up with some bugs, due the difficulties of developing a 3D game, with a very limited time, but the experience was awesome!
