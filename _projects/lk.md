I was with the TechSchool Team (I must thanks a lot TechSchool to get this team of champions together), that is composed by game development and 3D modeling students from TechSchool.

#### The Game

The Jam's theme was "Life in Space". The game is about an alien that arises on the moon and was trying to destroy the Earth. You play as the insane hero that goes to the moon to kill the monster and save our planet.

#### libGDX Jam - 2016

The [LibGDX Jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam) was a completely different experience. We had one month to develop an entire game from scratch, using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), a framework to develop games in Java.

#### Development

It is not easy to develop a game with Game Engines, but developing a game using only a programming language and a framework is even harder. [This game](https://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam/rate/49383) proves me that the experience of developing a game without a Game Engine should be mandatory for all game developers to do it at least once.
