I was with the [Machine Bear’s team and friends](https://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/machine-bear-jam) developing [Cute Evil](https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/cute-evil) at [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj-2016-one-month-away).

#### The Game

It was difficult to have an idea related to the [theme “Ritual”](https://globalgamejam.org/news/and-ggj16-theme). The brainstorming phase has given us the idea of working on a hardcore game, with a simple history and focus on gameplay. In the game, you play as a girl that suffers bully in school, and decide to take revenge, doing a ritual to invoke a demon that will help her to show all her strength. From now on is just blood and destruction in front of you!

#### Global Game Jam - 2016

In addition to the theme, the Game Jam had [diversifiers](https://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj16-diversifiers-are). We were able to achieve the "To infinity and beyond!", that was related to the procedural map generation (and a zero on the "Gandhi's Game"). A total of fourteen people worked on the game, within the 48 hours.

#### Development

The game was made with [UE4](https://www.unrealengine.com). The challenge on the game programming was to develop the procedural map generator and make the artificial intelligence work on it. Even having a short time, the game got a really satisfactory result, due to the coordination that the team created.
