I worked on [Urban Legends](http://machinebear.com.br/urban-legends.html) as game and level designer and programmer, at [Machine Bear](http://machinebear.com)

#### The Game

You play as P.J., a journalist, trapped in an abandoned hospital, looking for answers to the events of his past. To do so, he have to face [Jeff, the Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta#Jeff_the_Killer). Hide in armchairs, bellow beds, run in the hospital, understand the methods of Jeff, plan aread, and get ready to face endless misteries.

#### Reception

The game was well recepted, it was in the [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252009436) and get [accepted in 19 days](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/252009436/1400113588). The game received support, and were able to be translated to English, French, German, Norwegian, Portuguese(Brazil), Romanian and Spanish.

#### Development

The greatest chalange developing this game, was to create a complex and permissive scenario, and to create an artificial intelligence that was capable to explore the minimum spaces of the scenario. The game was made originally with [UDK 3](https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/WebHome.html), and then updated to [UE4(https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4). Unfortunally, the UE4 version have not been launched.
