I worked on the [Urban Legends](http://machinebear.com.br/urban-legends.html) project as Game and Level Designer and Programmer, at [Machine Bear](http://machinebear.com).

#### The Game

You play as P.J., a journalist, trapped in an abandoned hospital, looking for answers to the events of his past. To do so, he has to hide, run, solve puzzles, and face [Jeff, the Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta#Jeff_the_Killer).

#### Reception

The game was well received, and the game gets accepted in the [Steam Greenlight](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252009436) in [19 days](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/252009436/1400113588). The game received support from various fans of creepypastas, what allowed us to translate the game into English, French, German, Norwegian, Portuguese(Brazil), Romanian and Spanish.

#### Development


It was challenging to develop a game with a horror environment that allowed the player to explore all possibilities there. The artificial intelligence had to be precise to give the player the feeling of a pursue. The game was made originally with the [UDK 3](https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/WebHome.html) and then updated to [UE4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4).
