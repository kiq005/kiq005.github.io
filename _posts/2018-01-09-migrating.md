There still posts that I didn't migrate to this site, some I won't update because:
 - It's outdated, so I will post an updated version; or
 - I didn't had the time, or I have problems updating; or
 - I won't update, because the post doesn't make sense anymore.

But, here is a list of some good posts to check on the older sites:<!--break-->
