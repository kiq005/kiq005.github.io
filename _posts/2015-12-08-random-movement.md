![Position]({{ "/assets/posts_old/tumblr_nyx7h2Y0np1tbhz3oo1_400.gif"}})

Random Movement - Here I just set the ball to add some random value between -1 and 1 to position, and this is the result. There is nothing much expressive, but I must compare it to Brownian Motion, tomorrow we talk about the difference.<!--break-->

![Velocity]({{ "/assets/posts_old/tumblr_nyx7sxNz3R1tbhz3oo1_400.gif"}})

Random Movement - Now we have Brownian Motionâ€¦ well, kind off.

In this example, I not add the random value generated directly to the position, but to a speed vector, that sets the position. The result is more movement, and also we see it more smooth, and not broken movement.

Brownian Motion is related to the movement of a particle that collide with a lot of other particles, and results is a kind of random movement.
