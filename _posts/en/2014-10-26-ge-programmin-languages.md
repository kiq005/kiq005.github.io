Usually, and most often between **indie developers**, to develop a game some game engine is used. It make the development time shorter, and also help advancing tech because a lot of people are using the same platform and need to make it better.<!--break--> Here is some popular game engines and yours programming language.

**Unreal Engine**(UE) and **Unreal Development Kit**(UDK) uses a own language, that is the UnrealScript that is very similar to Java and C++(UE 4 abandoned the UnrealScript and now use the C++) . It also have and visual programming platform, the kismet (and Blueprint now in UE 4), and also support flash with ActionScript.

**CryEngine** accept scripts in **C++** and **Lua**, and uses **XML** to AI configuration, accept **ActionScript** and uses WYSIWYP interface to visual programming.

**Unity**, uses the UnityScript(**JavaScript**), but also accept **C#** and **Boo**(that is very similar to **Python**).

**Blender Engine** accepts **Python** scripting.

I hope it helps you to choose a game engine to work or a programming language to learn.

Thanks for reading.
