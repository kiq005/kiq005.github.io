Global Game Jam ran January 29 - 31, 2016.

I was with the Machine Bear’s team and friends developing Cute Evil!<!--break-->

The Jam’s theme was “Ritual”.

It was difficult to think about some thing with theme “Ritual”, but we think about day-by-day routine, indigena costumes, religious rituals, magician’s rituals, and so on. And we decide to a hardcore game, with a simple history.

You play as a girl that suffer some bully and decide to revenge this, by doing a ritual to cast an demon to help her. From this point is just blood and destruction in front of you! (We will receive zero on “Gandhi’s Game” Diversify).

The team was awesome and the development process was really funny!

Hope you enjoy the game, download and play it!
