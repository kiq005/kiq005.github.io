<p>As ferramentas estão aqui, logo mais haverá uma descrição na página!</p>

<p>As a programmer, I like to build tools and to automate things. In this page, will can find tools, no need do download or login, that will help you with some tasks, such as learning japanese, managing projects, bussiness and people, skeeping you life organized, and so on. Everything for free. Navigate throught the cathegories to visualize and use the tools.</p>

{% include elem/tools_list.html %}

<p>The tools are slipted on cathegories, so you can keep your focus in some specific thing that you are doing. Futhermore, each tool page has comentaries on the tools and also tips, links, references, so you can get thigs done fast and better.</p>

<p>Be aware that all the tools here does not storage anything in your computer, in this way, if you refresh the page, the info is gone, forever. For some tools, you can use the save/load option to keep the information.</p>

<p>If you have ideas for new tools, improvements/corrections for the existing ones, or if you have doubt on use any of them, send me a message! And if you like the tools, just buy me a coffee, so I have the fuel work more on them.</p>
