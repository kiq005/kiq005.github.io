<p>As a programmer, I like to build tools and to automate things. On this page, you can find tools, with no need to download or login, that will help you with some tasks, such learning Japanese, managing projects, business and people, and keeping your life organized. Everything for free.</p>

{% include elem/tools_list.html %}

<p>The tools organization is in a way to help you progress into the subject that you have in mind. Every tool page accompanies commentaries, tips, links, and references.</p>

<p>Be aware that the tools stores no info, so, you are safe, but if you refresh the page, everything is gone, forever. For some tools, you can use the save/load option to keep the information on your computer.</p>

<p>If you have ideas for new tools, improvements/corrections for the existing ones, doubt on using any of them, send me a message! And if you liked the tools, <a href='https://ko-fi.com/R6R58M9O'>Buy Me a Coffee</a>, so I have the fuel to work on more tools.</p>
